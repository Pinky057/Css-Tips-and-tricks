  <h1 class="tittle">css blend mode & CSS TEXT SElection</h1>
<h4>
  The default value is auto, which makes selection happen normally as you expect. “Normally” is a bit complicated. It’s worth quoting from the spec here:
</h4>
<p>
On the ::before and ::after pseudo elements, the computed value is none
If the element is an editable element, the computed value is contain
Otherwise, if the computed value of user-select on the parent of this element is all, the computed value is all
Otherwise, if the computed value of user-select on the parent of this element is none, the computed value is none
Otherwise, the computed value is text
In other words, it intelligently cascades and resets to a sensical state. It looks like maybe this feature could be used to make pseudo elements selectable, but no final word yet.
  <br><br>
  Firefox supports -moz-none, which is just like none except that it means sub-elements can override the cascade and become selectable again with -moz-user-select: text; As of Firefox 21, none behaves like -moz-none.
<br><br>
Internet Explorer also supports a so-far-proprietary value, element, in which you can select text inside the element but the selection will stop at the bounds of that element.
